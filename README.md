testing with the idea of dcpu nethack.

You have been trapped in the Dungeon of Dragons. You can escape if you
can find a way to stairs that are always located in South-East corner
of the dungeon.

Current version is a demo of the dungeon generation algorithm. Next
versions should include basic evils and perhaps something else also...

NOTE: Dungeon generation takes about 30 secs after you press any key
in the title page.
